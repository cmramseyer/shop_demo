  title: 'LG OLEDB8P series review'
  content: |
    For people who want the best picture they can afford, stretching the budget to get LG's B8 OLED is pretty tempting.
    It has image quality that's basically as good as any other OLED TV, for less.
    And that picture is still better than any non-OLED TV we've ever reviewed.'

  title: 'TCL 6 series (2018 Roku TV) review'
  content: |
    More than a year after I first reviewed it, the TCL 6 series is still the best TV for the money you can buy.
    No TV in its price range can beat it, and that includes new 2019 models like the Vizio M8 series I recently reviewed.
    At this point the 6 series is heavily discounted from its initial price, making it a better value than ever.
    The 65-inch model regularly gets down to $700, and the 55-inch version down to just $500.
    Even the massive 75-inch version of the 6 series is a bargain at $1,400.
    Those prices might be different by the time you read this, however.

  title: 'Suited up for this review'
  content: |
    It's rare that a laptop I've tested made me feel underdressed while using it.
    Actually, I take that back. I've never felt underdressed while using a laptop until I started using the HP Spectre x360.
    Maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration, but HP's premium two-in-one did make me feel like I should be suited up while I worked or,
    at the very least, that I should tuck in my shirt. Wrapped in metal with gem-cut edges (as opposed to the all-leather Spectre Folio),
    the 13.3-inch convertible weighs less than 3 pounds (1.3 kg) and is only 14.5 mm thick, so it barely registers that it's in your bag.

  title: 'Apple did it again'
  content: |
    On paper, it looked like an impressive, if predictable, set of internal component upgrades.
    Apple's 13-inch and 15-inch Touch Bar MacBook Pro models would get new eighth-gen Intel processors, more storage and RAM options,
    a color-temperature-sensing True Tone screen and other tweaks -- all nice improvements over a ho-hum 2017 update.
    At the same time, the slim unibody aluminum design would remain unchanged since its last design overhaul in late 2016,
    keeping features both loved (the giant track pad) and not-so-loved (the slim-travel keyboard, the USB-C-only connections).
    If anything, the expensive add-on option for one of Intel's new six-core Core i9 processors would appeal to pro-level users,
    such as video editors and 3D artists,
    who may be starting to feel that Apple isn't keeping up with their ever-expanding needs for high-end gear.
